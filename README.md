# Push SDK Chat Feature
Push Protocol (EPNS) is the worldâ€™s first decentralized communication & notification protocol for Web3.
Using the protocol, any smart contract, dApp, or backend service can send on-chain or off-chain notifications tied to the wallet addresses of users in a gasless, multichain, open, and platform-agnostic way.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
